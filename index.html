    <h1>Purpose and goal of website</h1>
    <p>This website has two main goals. First, it's here to help NTNU freshmen get to know Trondheim better. We want them to be familiar with all the different places and attractions in the city. Second, we want to provide information about the student housing options offered by SIT. This way, students can make informed decisions about where to live while studying at NTNU. Ultimately, we aim to make the transition to university life in Trondheim as smooth as possible for our new students.
    </p>
    <h1>Audience</h1>
    <p>Our primary audience for this website is the incoming freshmen at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. These students are embarking on an exciting new chapter in their lives, often away from their hometowns and familiar surroundings. These freshmen may come from various backgrounds and have diverse interests, so our goal is to provide them with a comprehensive guide that caters to their needs. We aim to make them more knowledgeable about the different facets of Trondheim, including shopping, recreational activities, socializing opportunities, and housing options provided by SIT (Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem). By addressing their unique needs and curiosities, we aim to ensure a smooth and enjoyable transition into university life in Trondheim for these new students. </p>
