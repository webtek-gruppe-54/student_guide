    <h1>4. Navigation Structure</h1>
    <p>The site structure and navigation of The Student Compass have been structured to provide users with an intuitive experience. Figure 1 shows the navigation structure and how the different pages intertwine and connect to each other. 
    </p>
    <p>The homepage serves as the main page, and provides an overview of what the guide offers.

After choosing what you want to discover the menu bar turns to a drop-down menu with options that are linked to Activities and Sit offerings. The homepage is also possible to access from every other subpage by clicking the logo at the top left corner. 
    </p>
    <p>Under Sit offerings the drop-down menu will show: Student housing and gyms. In a similar design Activities will offer further exploration into: Clubs and bars, walks, shopping and student friendly cafes. Users can access specific information about each offering by clicking the page and read more. In the footer users can read a short about-us section and find contact information. 
    </p>
    <p>The website's navigation structure is designed with user freedom in mind and ensures that users can access any section from the homepage or navigate back to the homepage from any other page using the menubar. This allows users to discover all the content available on the website.
