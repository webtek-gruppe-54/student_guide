    <h1>User Testing </h1>
    <p>We tested our users by giving them a set of tasks to do on the website to test out how smoothly the navigation is and the overall user experience. The following tasks were: 

      <ul>
        <li>Find information about the different gym possibilities</li><br>
        <li>Find the phone number to StudentCompass</li><br>
        <li>Find information about Ladestien</li><br>
        <li>Find information about Lerkendal Studentby</li><br>
        <li>What was the overall experience?</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Feedback Summary</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>Test 1: Chrome on Lenovo Thinkpad</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            When asked about finding information about the different gym possibilities, the user immediately navigated to the “Activities”-option in the nav-bar. The user then assumed the goal was to locate “Walks”. After exploring the webpage and checking out the different tabs the user eventually located the information.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            The user quickly located the phone number and found it intuitive that it was located in the footer, especially considering that the website does not have an “About us” page that provides more information. 
          </li><br>
          <li>
            The user found the information of both Ladestien and Lerkendal studentby easily.  
          </li><br>
          <li>
            The website provided the user with an overall positive experience. The user complimented the design and overall good usability in regard to both font size and organization. 
          </li><br>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Test 2 - Chrome on Macbook:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I expected to find information about gym-possibilities under “activities”. I think the tab “SIT offerings” should have a different name, it’s not very intuitive which information you can find there. 
          </li><br>
          <li>
            Suggestion for changes: Keep “activities” as a drop-down menu and have “SIT Gym” and “SIT Housing” as independent elements in the nav bar.
          </li><br>
          <li>
            The user commented that the rest of the navigation was good and the website was visually aesthetically pleasing
          </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Test 3 - Chrome on MacBook:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          It’s not very intuitive to understand which information you find under the different tabs in the nav bar. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
          The UI is very nice
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h1>Improvements from feedback</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>Improvements for feedback from test 1:</h3>
      <p>
        The navbar needs to provide the user with more information. A solution can be to add more options or change the names of the different tabs to make it more clear. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Improvements for feedback from test 2 and 3:</h3>
      <p>To make the navbar more intuitive, we can remove the drop-down meny “SIT offerings” and make them individual elements in the navbar. </p>
      <p>Current navn bar: </p>

    <h1>Self Reflection</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The designers of the group have learned more about what is possible with programming. It’s easy to get carried away in the prototype (in Figma) and make things that are hard to replicate with code. </li><br>
      <li>The developers of the group have gotten a better understanding of what a website need to be user friendly.</li>
